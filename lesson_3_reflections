When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If you are going to work in collaboration with other users and would like to facilitate an easy access to all your files you probably may want to use a remote repository. Also, if you are going to let your project take many contribuitors that could fork your project for  improvements, revisions and development out of your main repository pushing it to Github is probably the best solution. Additionally, If would like to demonstrate the history of your project for others to see what you have been working on i.e portfolio, resume.
